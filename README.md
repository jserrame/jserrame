# Languages and Projects
* I'm currently learning R at my school because it is a required course in my program. I'm also learning Python on the side for the [100 Days of Data.Trek/100 jours de Ran.don√©√©](http://www.aebinum.umontreal.ca/datatrek2021.html#). I'm still a beginner at both languages.
* Right now I'm working on this [dataset](https://github.com/Jeremieauger/qualoPredict) recommended by J√©r√©mie, one of the mentors at 100 jours de Ran.don√©√©.
  * This project is about predicting water quality levels on the shores of the larger Montreal island which can be relevant for summer activities such as kayaking, paddling, and fishing.
